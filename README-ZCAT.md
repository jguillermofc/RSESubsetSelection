# ZCAT Pareto Front Generator

This repository provides tools to **generate Pareto Front approximations** for the 20 scalable **ZCAT benchmark problems**. These problems are widely used for testing multi-objective optimization algorithms in scenarios with scalable difficulty and characteristics.

The main function of interest is:

```python
generate_pareto_front(mop, max_solutions, nvar, nobj, Level, Bias_flag, Complicated_PS_flag, Imbalance_flag)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Function Description

### **`generate_pareto_front`**
Generates a Pareto Front approximation for a given ZCAT multi-objective problem and saves it to a `.pof` file.

#### **Parameters**
- `mop` *(int)*: Index of the ZCAT problem (0 = ZCAT1, ..., 19 = ZCAT20).
- `max_solutions` *(int)*: Number of solutions to generate for the PF.
- `nvar` *(int)*: Number of decision variables.
- `nobj` *(int)*: Number of objectives.
- `Level` *(int)*: Difficulty level (1‚Äì6). **Do not use levels 5 or 6** for PF generation.
- `Bias_flag` *(int)*: Whether to include bias (1 = True, 0 = False).
- `Complicated_PS_flag` *(int)*: Whether to use a complicated Pareto set (1 = True, 0 = False).
- `Imbalance_flag` *(int)*: Whether to include imbalance (1 = True, 0 = False).

#### **Returns**
A list of objective vectors representing the Pareto Front approximation.

#### **Output**
- A `.pof` file stored in the folder `zcat-optimal-solutions/`.
- Filename format:  
  ```
  {ProblemName}_{NumberOfSolutions}_{NumberOfObjectives}D.pof
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  ZCAT3_1000_03D.pof
  ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### **Option 1: Use `__main__` to batch generate PFs**
The script is configured to generate PFs for all 20 ZCAT problems, for objectives from 2 to 10, and various cardinalities.

Run:
```bash
python zcat_generate_PF.py
```

This will create multiple `.pof` files in the `zcat-optimal-solutions/` directory.

---

### **Option 2: Call `generate_pareto_front()` directly**
You can also import the function in your own Python code:

```python
from zcat_generate_PF import generate_pareto_front

# Example: Generate PF for ZCAT1 with 1000 solutions and 3 objectives
mop = 0  # ZCAT1
max_solutions = 1000
nobj = 3
nvar = nobj * 10  # Standard configuration
Level = 1
Bias_flag = 0
Complicated_PS_flag = 0
Imbalance_flag = 0

pf = generate_pareto_front(mop, max_solutions, nvar, nobj, Level, Bias_flag, Complicated_PS_flag, Imbalance_flag)
print("Generated PF with", len(pf), "solutions")
```

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Configuration

- `Level = 1`
- `Bias_flag = 0`
- `Complicated_PS_flag = 0`
- `Imbalance_flag = 0`

**Warning:** Levels 5 and 6 are not recommended for PF generation due to precision issues.

---

## üìú Output File Format

Each `.pof` file starts with:
```
# {number_of_solutions} {number_of_objectives}
```
Followed by lines where each line represents an objective vector.

Example:
```
# 1000 3
1.234567e+00 5.678900e-01 9.101112e-02
...
```
